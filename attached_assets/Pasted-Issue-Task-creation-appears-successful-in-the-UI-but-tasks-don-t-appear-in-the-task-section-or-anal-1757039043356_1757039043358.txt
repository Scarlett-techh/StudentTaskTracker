Issue: Task creation appears successful in the UI but tasks don't appear in the task section or analytics. The error message shows: "Failed to communicate with the server. Please check your connection and try again."

Background:

Frontend: React with TypeScript, using TanStack Query for data fetching

Backend: Express.js with Neon PostgreSQL database

The task creation form submits data, shows success message, but tasks don't appear in UI

API endpoints exist for GET /api/tasks (works) and POST /api/tasks (problematic)

Database storage layer is implemented with Drizzle ORM

What's been tried:

Added comprehensive query invalidation in frontend

Verified task API endpoints exist in routes.ts

Checked that DatabaseStorage has createTask method implementation

Added debug logging to task creation endpoint

Database connection test endpoint (/api/health) works

Request:
Please diagnose and fix the task creation issue by:

Check server logs for errors when POST /api/tasks is called

Verify database connection is properly established and tables exist

Test the createTask method in isolation to ensure it works correctly

Check authentication middleware isn't blocking the POST request

Ensure CORS is properly configured for POST requests

Validate the data flow from frontend form → API → database → response

Fix any issues found without breaking existing functionality

Add proper error handling to provide clearer error messages

Key areas to focus on:

Database connection and schema validation

API endpoint parameter handling

Authentication middleware for POST requests

Data returned from createTask operation

Frontend cache updating after successful creation

Please provide:

Specific error messages found in logs

Steps taken to resolve the issue

Verification that tasks now appear in both task list and analytics

Confirmation that no existing functionality was broken

Priority: Fix the root cause rather than applying temporary workarounds.

This prompt gives the AI agent clear direction about what to investigate while emphasizing the importance of maintaining existing functionality. It focuses on the specific issue without asking for unnecessary changes to other parts of the system.
